# Response Methods

Response Methods are the 'how' to do a Response Action. There may be many different ways you can do an action, that will often depend on the technology options you have
at your disposal. By splitting these all into different Methods, we can declutter Response Actions and provide signposting to these scripts or manual steps (I believe Cortex calls these 
'neurons') 

At the moment I can see them being one of three types:
1. Manual Methods - a step by step guide of how to manually do this
2. In-Line scripts - anything like a SIEM search, or a powershell snippet
3. Scripts/Tools - Links to any tools or external scripts. In this case the Response Method might also list the steps you take in that tool.
